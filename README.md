# ProductSpringWeb


This repository contains the source code for a project that consists of a Java Spring backend and a React frontend. The project aims to provide a web application for managing and retrieving information about various products.The backend of the application is built using Java and the Spring framework, specifically the Spring Boot framework. It utilizes Spring Data JPA for data persistence and provides a RESTful API for interacting with the database.

On the other hand, the frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides an intuitive and responsive user interface to view, search, and add products. The Details of the React frontend can be found in another one of my repositories.

### Features

<li>Product Management: Users can add new products to the system, providing details such as name, type, place, and warranty period.</li>
<li>Product Search: The application allows users to search for products based on their name, type, place, or warranty period.</li>
<li>Data Persistence: Products and their corresponding information are stored and managed in a relational database, facilitating efficient retrieval and storage.</li>
<li>API Integration: The backend exposes a set of RESTful endpoints that the frontend can interact with, enabling seamless communication between the two layers.</li>

Below there in an explanantion if what each class does and how it all builds to create the backend of out application.

### Product Class

```java
package com.telusko.ProductSpringWeb;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.Data;

@Entity
@Data
@Table(name="product")
public class Product {
```

- The `package` statement indicates that this class belongs to the `com.telusko.ProductSpringWeb` package.
- The `import` statements import necessary dependencies for the class.
  - `jakarta.persistence.*` is imported to use annotations related to Java Persistence API (JPA) for database mapping.
  - `lombok.Data` is imported to automatically generate getter, setter, and other boilerplate code.
- The `@Entity` annotation marks this class as an entity, representing a database table.
- The `@Data` annotation, provided by Lombok, generates getter, setter, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods for the class.
- The `@Table(name="product")` annotation specifies the name of the database table associated with this entity.

```java
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private int id;
```

- The `@Id` annotation marks the `id` field as the primary key for the entity.
- The `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)` annotation specifies that the primary key values are automatically generated by the underlying database, using an identity column.

```java
    @Column(name="name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name="type")
    private String type;
    private String place;
    
    private int warranty;
```

- The `@Column(name="name")` annotation specifies that the `name` field should be mapped to the database column named "name". Similarly, the `type` field is mapped to the "type" column.
- The `place` field does not have any annotation, so it will not be directly mapped to a specific database column.
- The `warranty` field is also not annotated, suggesting that it won't be mapped to a database column directly.

```java
    public Product() {
    }

    public Product(String name, String type, String place, int warranty) {
        this.name = name;
        this.type = type;
        this.place = place;
        this.warranty = warranty;
    }
}
```

- This section includes two constructors for the `Product` class.
- The default constructor `Product()` is empty, allowing the creation of an instance without providing any initial values.
- The second constructor `Product(String name, String type, String place, int warranty)` accepts parameter values for each field and initializes them accordingly.

### ProductService Class

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;

import java.util.List;

@Component
public class ProductService {
    @Autowired
    ProductDB db;
```

This class declaration defines the `ProductService` class. It is responsible for handling business logic related to products. The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject an instance of the `ProductDB` class into this class. `ProductDB` is assumed to be a repository or a service class that provides access to the database for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on `Product` entities.

```java
public Product addProduct(Product product) {
    return db.save(product);
}
```

This method, `addProduct`, receives a `Product` object as a parameter and uses the `db` instance to save the product in the database. It returns the saved `Product` object.

```java
public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
    return db.findAll();
}
```

The `getAllProducts` method retrieves all the products from the database by calling the `findAll` method on the `db` instance (assuming it provides such functionality). It returns a list of `Product` objects.

```java
public List<Product> getProductsByname(String name) {
    return db.findByNameContainsIgnoreCase(name);
}
```

The `getProductsByname` method retrieves a list of products from the database by calling the `findByNameContainsIgnoreCase` method on the `db` instance, passing the `name` parameter. 

```java
public List<Product> getProductByPlace(String pl) {
    return db.findByPlaceContainsIgnoreCase(pl);
}
```

The `getProductByPlace` method retrieves products from the database by calling the `findByPlaceContainsIgnoreCase` method on the `db` instance, passing the `pl` parameter. 

```java
public List<Product> getProductsBytype(String type) {
    return db.findByTypeContainsIgnoreCase(type);
}
```

The `getProductsBytype` method retrieves products from the database by calling the `findByTypeContainsIgnoreCase` method on the `db` instance, passing the `type` parameter. 

```java
public List<Product> getProductsByWarranty(int warranty) {
    return db.findByWarranty(warranty);
}
```

The `getProductsByWarranty` method retrieves products from the database by calling the `findByWarranty` method on the `db` instance, passing the `warranty` parameter. It returns a list of products with the specified warranty period.

### ProductDB Class

```java
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

import java.util.List;

@Repository
public interface ProductDB extends JpaRepository<Product, Integer> {
```

The `ProductDB` interface extends `JpaRepository<Product, Integer>`, which means it inherits all the CRUD methods defined in `JpaRepository` and can be used to perform database operations on `Product` entities. The `Product` class is the entity class being managed, and `Integer` represents the type of the primary key.

```java
List<Product> findByNameContainsIgnoreCase(String name);
```

This method declaration returns a list of products whose name contains the specified name, performing a case-insensitive search.

```java
List<Product> findByPlaceContainsIgnoreCase(String pl);
```

This method declaration returns a list of products whose place contains the specified place, performing a case-insensitive search.

```java
List<Product> findByTypeContainsIgnoreCase(String type);
```

This method declaration returns a list of products whose type contains the specified type, performing a case-insensitive search.

```java
List<Product> findByWarranty(int warranty);
```

This method declaration returns a list of products with the specified warranty period.

### ProductController Class

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import java.util.List;

@RestController
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")
public class ProductController {
```

The `ProductController` class is marked with the `@RestController` annotation, indicating that it is a RESTful controller that handles incoming HTTP requests and produces HTTP responses. The `@CrossOrigin` annotation is used to enable cross-origin resource sharing, allowing requests from the specified origin (in this case, "http://localhost:3000").

```java
@Autowired
ProductService ps;
```

The `@Autowired` annotation is used to inject an instance of the `ProductService` class into this controller. This allows the controller to access and use the methods provided by the service class.

```java
@GetMapping("/allproducts")
public List<Product> getAllProducts() {
    return ps.getAllProducts();
}
```

This method is mapped to the `GET` request for the `/allproducts` endpoint. It invokes the `getAllProducts` method from the `ProductService` class and returns the list of all products.

```java
@GetMapping("/productsbyname/{name}")
public List<Product> getProductsByName(@PathVariable String name){
    return ps.getProductsByname(name);
}
```

This method is mapped to the `GET` request for the `/productsbyname/{name}` endpoint. The `@PathVariable` annotation is used to bind the `{name}` path variable from the URL to the `name` parameter of the method. It invokes the `getProductsByname` method from the `ProductService` class, passing the `name` parameter, and returns the list of products with names containing the specified value.

```java
@GetMapping("/productsbytype/{type}")
public List<Product> getProductsByType(@PathVariable String type){
    return ps.getProductsBytype(type);
}
```

This method is mapped to the `GET` request for the `/productsbytype/{type}` endpoint. It is similar to the previous method but searches for products by type instead of name.

```java
@PostMapping("/products")
public String addProduct(@RequestBody Product product){
    ps.addProduct(product);
    return "New Product Added Successfully";
}
```

This method is mapped to the `POST` request for the `/products` endpoint. It invokes the `addProduct` method from the `ProductService` class, passing the received `Product` object, and returns a success message as a string.

```java
@GetMapping({"/productsbyplace/{place}"})
public List<Product> getProductByPlace(@PathVariable String place){
    return ps.getProductByPlace(place);
}
```

This method is mapped to the `GET` request for the `/productsbyplace/{place}` endpoint. It searches for products by place, similar to the previous methods.

```java
@GetMapping({"/productsbywarranty/{warranty}"})
public List<Product> getProductsByWarranty(@PathVariable int warranty){
    return ps.getProductsByWarranty(warranty);
}
```

This method is mapped to the `GET` request for the `/productsbywarranty/{warranty}` endpoint. It searches for products by warranty period, similar to the previous methods.
